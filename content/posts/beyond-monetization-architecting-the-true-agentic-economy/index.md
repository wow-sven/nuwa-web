For the past two years, the industry has been captivated by the generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs). According to research from Goldman Sachs, AI has the potential to boost global GDP by 7% (or nearly $7 trillion).

But as this new wave of AI agents emerges, a critical question arises: Nuwa AI’s CEO, Haichao, recently tackled in his post, ["The Elephant in the Room."](https://nuwa.dev/blog/the-elephant-in-the-room-how-can-ai-devs-actually-monetize)

He asked: How can AI developers actually monetize their work?

His answer laid out Nuwa's revolutionary monetization layer: a world where developers build modular "Caps," earn usage-based payouts, and get paid directly by other agents, instantly and automatically. This is the vital, tactical solution developers have been waiting for.

However, a viable economic paradigm requires more than just a new payment rail. It requires a large, healthy economy to function on top of it. The first step is to address developer monetization, but this raises a far larger question: why will users pay for these Caps in the first place?

The solution rests in resolving an issue far larger than developer monetization: releasing every user from the malfunctioning, frustrating "App-Centric Prison." This is the complete picture. The grand strategy behind Nuwa is not only to create a better way to be paid, but also to design an entirely new, user-first economy that will generate trillions of dollars in value for developers to capture.

## The App-Centric Prison: The $7 Trillion Problem We Must Solve First

Think about your digital life today. How many subscriptions do you pay for? How many times do you log in and out of different services to complete a single goal, like planning a trip or managing a project? This is the app-centric prison. It creates three critical failures:

- Cognitive fragmentation: Each app has its own user interface, logic, and data store. The user is forced to be the manual integrator, wasting significant time and mental energy simply navigating these digital silos. Context is lost with each tap, and intent must be reestablished multiple times.
- Economic inefficiency: The subscription model has grown significantly. Users are saddled with "subscription stacking," which entails paying for overlapping or redundant functionalities. Innovation is limited since developers must construct entire programs around a single feature rather than providing the function directly.
- Data Dispossession: Your information, your preferences, history, and identity is spread across dozens of corporate databases. It cannot be used holistically to better serve you because it does not belong to you and is inaccessible to a central intelligence acting on your behalf.

At Nuwa, our vision is not to build a better app or even a better agent within this broken system. Our vision is to replace the system itself. We believe everyone should stop using different apps for different services. Instead, they should use a single input bar to express their needs and intentions and see them done.

## Nuwa's Architecture for a User-First Economy

This is the architecture that will unlock a new world of value, creating immense demand for the Caps that developers build.

# Pillar 1: The Personalized Agent Framework

Nuwa's personal agent is a persistent framework with memory, reasoning, and execution capabilities. It deeply understands you by learning your habits and preferences, becoming a non-exportable digital companion. This unique personalization is our core differentiator, all built on a privacy-first architecture where the user controls their sensitive data.

# Pillar 2: The Nuwa Capability Protocol (NCP)

To break free from the app prison, we must change how services are built and exposed. Instead of building siloed applications, developers on Nuwa build Capabilities, or "Caps." A Cap is a structured, interoperable service endpoint defined by our open-source Nuwa Capability Protocol (NCP).

Consider a Cap to be a standardized "skill" that every agent may learn, comprehend, and use. For example, a "TranslateText" Cap might specify inputs (text, target language), outputs (translated text), visible pricing (e.g., $0.001 per 1,000 characters), and authentication requirements. By standardizing this, NCP enables seamless interoperability. An agent might use a "TranscribeAudio" Cap, a "TranslateText" Cap, and a "SendEmail" Cap to build a workflow that would have previously required three distinct programs and human data transfer. This encourages a thriving, composable ecosystem in which developers create modular functions rather than rigid applications.

# Pillar 3: The Service Marketplace & Economic Engine

Where do these Caps live? In the Nuwa Service Marketplace. This is where our revolutionary economic model comes to life. We are fundamentally rejecting the extractive, rent-seeking models of the past. There are zero platform fees or transaction taxes on Nuwa. Builders earn 100% of the value they create.

Our role is not to be a landlord, but a growth partner. We monetize by becoming the trusted financial services layer for the entire ecosystem. This happens in two primary ways:

1. Builder Growth Financing: As promising Caps gain traction, we offer their creators revenue-linked financing. This isn't a loan, it's a growth partnership. We provide capital in exchange for a capped share of future earnings. It’s like Stripe Capital, but for the fundamental units of the agent economy. We make money by helping builders grow, not by taxing them.
2. Protocol-Aligned Asset Issuance: Because Nuwa has a unique overview of the whole system, we can easily see which AI services are the most popular and successful. This allows us to create new ways for people to invest in that success. Think of it like this: our platform becomes the main dashboard for this new agent economy, similar to a Bloomberg Terminal for finance, providing the key information and tools needed to fund the next generation of digital services.

## Use-Case examples

# How We'll Get Started

To achieve such a big vision, we need a smart and practical starting point. We will begin by focusing on solving tasks that are currently very annoying and require using lots of different apps. We want to prove our agent-based approach is at least 10 times better.

For instance, right now, setting up a business online is a major headache involving dozens of steps across many different websites. With Nuwa, you simply tell your agent your idea:

*"I want to start an online artisanal coffee store called 'The Daily Grind' based in Los Angeles."*

Your agent then does all the work, finding and using the right tools ("Caps") to get everything done automatically. A task that normally takes days becomes a single, simple conversation.

By solving these major pain points first, we will attract enough users and useful tools to create momentum. Eventually, we'll build enough value to make single, standalone apps a thing of the past.

## Conclusion: From Monetization to a Movement

The agentic economy is the most significant platform shift of our lifetime. At the end of the day, [developers need a better way to get paid](https://nuwa.dev/blog/the-elephant-in-the-room-how-can-ai-devs-actually-monetize). Nuwa's zero-fee, direct-payment model is the tactical answer.

But the full, strategic answer is the vast new economy we are creating by finally solving the user's core problem. We are building a world that will make developers’ Caps indispensable. The monetization model is the engine, but freeing the user from the app prison is the fuel that will power it for the next decade. One cannot exist without the other.

For developers ready to build the future of services, and for users who believe technology should work for them, not the other way around: the revolution begins now. Join us in building a world where one bar truly unlocks everything.
