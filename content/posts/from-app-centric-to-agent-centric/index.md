For decades, our digital lives have revolved around apps.

We download them, switch between them, manage their settings, juggle their notifications. Each app is a silo: one for messages, one for calendars, another for tasks, another for files. Even when they integrate, the user is still the one stitching everything together. We search, jump, configure, copy, and repeat. This app-centric world has become more powerful, yes — but also more fragmented.

But something’s changing.

### The Rise of Capable Agents

With the rise of large language models, multi-modal AI, and increasingly powerful APIs, we’re entering a new paradigm: **agent-centric computing**.

In this world, you don’t open an app. You express intent.

- “Book me a flight to Singapore and notify my team.”
- “Summarize this PDF and add a task if it’s actionable.”
- “Find the cheapest way to transfer this file and notify the recipient.”

The agent interprets, remembers, plans, acts — across services. Not confined to one app. Not bound to one brand. Not limited to one domain.

This isn’t a vision for the distant future. It’s already here, emerging at the edges — but the user experience and infrastructure haven’t caught up yet.

### Why the App-Centric Model is Breaking

The app model was built for a different computing era — one of desktops and icons, not cloud-native services and ubiquitous AI. Its flaws are becoming more obvious:

- **Context switching** slows us down.
- **Data silos** limit personalization.
- **Subscription fatigue** fragments utility behind paywalls.
- **Developer overhead** multiplies with every platform and integration.

Meanwhile, users want outcomes, not interfaces. They want the job done, not the journey through five apps to get there.

### What Agent-Centric Really Means

Agent-centric doesn’t mean “just a chatbot.” It means:

- A **persistent interface** where you can express anything: text, voice, file, emotion.
- An **agent with memory**, so it knows your style, history, preferences.
- A **shared protocol**, so services expose what they can do in a machine-readable, agent-callable way.
- A **decentralized ecosystem**, where developers can create and monetize atomic capabilities, not full-stack apps.

### Why This Shift Matters

This shift isn’t just a UI change — it’s a structural rethinking of digital experience. Just like the shift from desktop to web or mobile, this new model unlocks:

- **Speed**: Express and execute in seconds.
- **Personalization**: Context-rich, memory-aware actions.
- **Accessibility**: A single, natural interface across all devices.
- **Openness**: Anyone can build a capability; no gatekeepers.

Just like the web needed HTTP, or smartphones needed app stores, agents need protocols and runtimes. That’s what will define the next decade.

### Who Builds This Future?

Not the incumbents alone. Big tech will adapt agent features into their walled gardens. But the real agent-centric revolution — open, cross-service, user-first — will come from those who build protocols, not platforms. From developers who create capabilities, not full-stack apps. From ecosystems where the user owns the agent, and the agent works for the user.

That’s where **Nuwa** comes in.

Nuwa isn’t just building a product — it’s building the foundation for agent-centric computing:

- A **Nuwa Client** that acts as your personal interface, holding your memory, identity, and wallet.
- An **Agent Capability Protocol (ACP)** that defines how agents invoke granular, composable functions called **Caps**.
- A fully **open ecosystem** where developers earn directly as their Caps are used, with no platform lock-in.

In a landscape of closed integrations and proprietary interfaces, Nuwa is creating shared infrastructure — so any service can be made agent-callable, and any user can have an agent that truly works for them.

Because the agent era won't be defined by who has the most plugins.

It will be defined by who dares to replace the app model altogether.
