Over the past year, AI has advanced at an astonishing pace — but also behind increasingly higher walls. Expensive subscriptions, scattered apps, and centralized gateways have made it harder than ever for everyday people to truly access, build with, or benefit from AI. The potential is there — but it’s locked away.

Maybe you’ve used ChatGPT — but does it help with all those tiny, scattered tasks in your day? Maybe you’ve tried AI agents — but how many monthly subscriptions can you juggle? Each one demands sign-ups, logins, credit card info, a trial run… only to repeat the process again and again.

**Imagine instead:** every AI model and agent you need, all in one place. One login. One unified access point. No switching between tabs, no endless subscriptions — just pay per use, whenever you need it.

That’s what we’re building with **Nuwa AI** — an open AI agent platform where anyone can use, create, and monetize models and agents. It’s powered by a unified decentralized identity (DID) for secure, universal login, and an AI-native payment layer designed for instant, borderless, and sustainable transactions.

## How Nuwa AI unlocks AI for everyone

Nuwa AI is an open agent platform that allows users to access a wide range of AI agents through a single account, while giving developers a global marketplace to publish, distribute, and earn from their creations. We bridge the gap between users and the right AI agents — and help developers reach their audiences without friction.

At its core, the platform is built on three pillars:

#### 1. Abstract AI Agents with Caps

A **Capability (Cap)** is the atomic unit of functionality in Nuwa. Each Cap combines:

- **Model** – Any LLM from any provider (or your own) via a standard OpenAI-compatible API.
- **Prompt** – A public, customizable prompt that defines the agent’s behavior.
- **MCP Servers** – Extensions to access external data or perform complex tasks.

Whether it’s a simple chatbot, a multi-step workflow, or a full SaaS replacement, a Cap is a reusable, composable building block.

#### 2. Unified Identity with DID

With **Decentralized Identifiers (DID)**, users log in once and gain secure, portable access to every agent. Developers can verify and manage access without relying on centralized gatekeepers, enabling privacy, interoperability, and full user control.

#### 3. Instant, AI-Native Payments — Powered by the Nuwa Token

For developers, monetization should be instant and borderless. Nuwa AI integrates crypto-based payment channels so agents can charge per use, subscription, or custom pricing — with near-zero delay and no dependency on traditional rails.

Under the hood, all settlements will be powered by the **Nuwa Token** — the universal transaction layer for the ecosystem. Every AI call, data access, and workflow completion will create usage-driven demand for the token. Automated revenue sharing will ensure that creators, infrastructure providers, DAOs, and referrers are rewarded instantly, keeping the network economically sustainable.

In short, it’s not just a payment method — it’s the economic backbone and coordination layer of the open AI agent economy.

*(Note: Nuwa Token support is not yet live in the beta. Current payments run on standard crypto settlement, with token integration planned in an upcoming release.)*

## Why it matters

AI is like electricity — a universal utility — while AI agents are the appliances that put it to work. Today, most agents are packaged as standalone apps, and users pay app providers instead of directly paying for the AI utility. That’s like paying the toaster manufacturer every time you make toast.

We believe this app-centric model fragments experiences and limits innovation. Nuwa replaces it with a **modular, interoperable agent economy** where functionality is delivered as Caps, and AI utility flows seamlessly to where it’s needed.

We imagine a world where:

- A writer packages their style into a **Writing Cap** that earns income with every use.
- A coder publishes Caps from tiny utilities to rocket-science-level systems — monetizing instantly, globally
- A teacher turns their teaching style into a Cap so students can learn anytime.
- Any user simply states their goal — and Nuwa instantly delivers the right Caps, with zero setup.

Our goal: make Nuwa AI the universal outlet for all AI agents, so AI becomes an effortless extension of everyone.

## Be part of the beta

We’re excited to announce the **beta launch** of the Nuwa AI platform. The core building blocks are now live, including:

- **Cap creation & publishing**
- **DID identity creation & authorization**
- **AI-native crypto payments** *(currently using standard crypto settlement — Nuwa Token integration coming soon)*

Developers, this is your invitation to launch your first Cap and help shape the agent-centric future from day one.
