# Draw it. Ask it. Switch it.

Most AI tools make you bounce between apps: one tab to brainstorm, another to diagram, another to “ask a different model.” NUWA keeps it in one place. Two features make that possible:

1. **Visual Canvas (Excalidraw Cap):** turn any idea into a mind map, org chart, or freeform canvas right inside NUWA.  
  
2. **Multi-LLM Switching (shared thread):** hop between models (e.g., Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek) without losing context.

Below: what each does, why it matters, and how to try it in under a minute.

All with Nuwa platform: https://test-app.nuwa.dev/

## 1) Visual Canvas (Excalidraw Cap)

#### What it is

An in-app canvas that turns short prompts into editable diagrams, mind maps, organizational charts, journey maps, canvases. You can drag nodes, recolor, add notes, then export to PNG/SVG/Markdown.

#### Why it matters

Ideas stick when you can see them. Instead of juggling a notes app + a diagram tool, you stay in NUWA: brainstorm → sketch → share.

#### Try it (copy-paste prompts)

- **Mind map (personal goals):**  
*“Create a mind map titled ‘Personal Goals — Next 12 Weeks’ with branches Health, Career, Relationships, Learning → sub-branches Outcomes, Weekly Actions, Milestones (wk4/8/12), Metrics.”*

- **Org chart (team setup):**  
*“Make an org chart for ‘NUWA Launch Team’: Product (PM, Designer), Engineering (Backend, Frontend, AI), DevRel (Docs, Samples), Marketing (Content, Performance), Community (Discord, Ambassadors).”*

- **Roadmap (simple):**  
*“Sketch a Q4 roadmap with lanes: Core (DID login, Wallet), Caps (Payments, Canvas), Growth (Ambassador program), Ops (Support). Add month markers Oct/Nov/Dec.”*

#### How to use it (30 seconds)

1. Open Canvas (Excalidraw) in NUWA.  
  
2. Choose Mind Map / Org Chart / Blank.  
  
3. Paste a prompt → Auto-layout → tweak.  
  
4. Export PNG/SVG or Copy Markdown into docs.  
  
**Pro tip:** Chain it with other Caps:  
`Canvas.New → AI.Structure → AutoLayout → Export.PNG → Notion.Save`

## 2) Multi-LLM Switching (same chat, different brains)

#### What it is

In NUWA, your chat history is shared across models. Start with Grok on “Twitter’s algorithm,” then switch to ChatGPT (or any other LLM) in the same thread. No re-explaining. No new tabs.

#### Why it matters

Different models shine at different things: reasoning, creativity, brevity, code. By switching models on the same context, you get multiple expert takes in minutes.

#### Try it (copy-paste prompts)

**Add this once to your thread (for easy comparisons):**  
*“Return in this format: 3 bullets + 1-sentence takeaway + confidence (0–1).”*

- **Twitter/X algorithm explainer:**  
*“Explain how Twitter/X ranks posts today; list the top engagement signals, likely downranks, and 3 safe growth tactics for small accounts.”*  
→ Run with Grok → switch to ChatGPT → switch to Claude. Compare.  
  
- **Code review:**  
*“Here’s a Python function (paste). Suggest 3 improvements for readability/perf, then show a revised version.”*  
  
- **Tone rewrite:**  
*“Rewrite this email to be warm-concise in 2 sentences: ‘We can’t approve your request due to missing documents. Please resubmit the form.’”*  
  
- **Quick strategy (ETH 4H):**  
*“Give 3 support/resistance levels, one entry/exit idea, and a cautious risk note (no leverage).”*

#### How to use it (20 seconds)

1. Open a NUWA chat, paste your prompt.  
  
2. Click Model → pick Grok/ChatGPT/Claude/DeepSeek.  
  
3. Hit Run. Then switch the model—your context stays.  
  
4. Skim differences; you’ll spot strengths fast.  
  

Pro tip: Ask each model to include a confidence score and assumptions that make comparison obvious. ([Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXJmdWZrbBE))

## Put them together: think → see → decide

A quick real-world loop:

1. Brainstorm ideas with model A (e.g., growth ideas for launch).  
  
2. Switch to model B for counterpoints and risks—same chat.  
  
3. Send to Canvas to auto-create a mind map of the final plan.  
  
4. Export PNG/Markdown and share with your team.  
  

No copy-paste. No extra apps. Everything in one flow.

## FAQ (super short)

- **Will I pay every time?**

Many Caps are free. Otherwise, NUWA shows a pre-run estimate (usually cents). You can set per-run and monthly caps.

- **Can I keep the visuals?** 

Yes—export PNG/SVG/Markdown.

- **Is my thread private?** 

Actions are signed to your decentralized ID (DID) and you get receipts. You control which Caps can read or write.

## Try it now

- Open Canvas (Excalidraw) → paste a prompt → Auto-layout → Export.  
  
- Open a chat → ask a question → switch models → compare answers.  
  

One platform, many use cases—zero tab-hopping. That’s the NUWA way.
